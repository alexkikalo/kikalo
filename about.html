          <p>​Have you ever stopped to look at the time you live in?



We live in an amazing future that was science fiction in the previous century.

AI chatbots, reusable rockets, self-driving cars, and personal robots are all incredible recent developments, but look closer.



The computer itself was once science fiction. Escaping Earth's atmosphere was once science fiction. The horseless carriage was once science fiction.



The truth is time brings innovation. History proves this very well. In the past few centuries the western world has been particularly skillful at developing new technologies. But in recent decades, we've fallen short of our true potential.



But don't we have self-driving cars?



In the 1980s we expected flying cars by the 2010s. It's the 2020s and there are no flying cars. We are behind. This is especially true in America.



America creates the impossible. Whether driven by a stubborn refusal to concede until death prevails or by an optimistic vision of a yet unrealized tomorrow, or both, American seems to be a center of innovation. The light bulb, the personal computer, the assembly line, the list will continue. And it must.



It is time for America to remember who it is. We created the future we live in today. We will create the future of tomorrow.



Kikalo Designs seeks to equip the creators of that tomorrow with the tools, inspiration, and opportunities to establish those visions today.



Join us and let's shape the American tomorrow. We are only getting started./p>
